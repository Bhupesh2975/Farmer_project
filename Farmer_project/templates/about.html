    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
        Smart Farmer is a machine learning-based solution that suggests the most suitable crop to grow based on soil nutrients (NPK), pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall.
        <br><br>
        This system aims to help Indian farmers make more informed crop decisions using AI to improve their productivity and yield. Built with Python and Flask, this project demonstrates real-world application of data science in agriculture.
